# moveBall
Using basic graphics and div tags to create moving balls of changing colors and sizes

<h2>installation</h2>
To look at the results of the code, copy and paste into your favorite text editor and save it as a .html file. Then click on the file. It should open up in your default browser.

<h2>Usage</h2>
This project shows you how to create graphics using basic CSS and the setInterval function. You can learn how to create movement within boundaries and change the size of your graphics.

<h2>Support</h2> 
If you need help understanding the code, feel free to contact me at a.suh.91@gmail.com. 

<h2>Roadmap</h2> 
Later I might be looking at ways to change the size and color at the same time.
